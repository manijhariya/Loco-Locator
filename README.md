A fully developed location sender of device through e-mail..

# HOW??
The goal is to develope a general purpose location sender as a 
minimal user. Features can with extra accuracy. But i have tried
to keep it as easy-to-use and efficient as possible.
This program is general purpose. But a simple script can make our lost
devices found. If they run this script in devices with some delay.

This project uses the [ipwhois.app](https://www.ipwhois.app/) API to handle
the processing of own ip and returning a json. It intends to work for free
in 10,000 request per month limit. This project and its function are their
own isolated work (unless stated otherwise), however they require jq,msmtp,
curl and working internet connect to work correctly..

If you would like to run this code you need to first install some dependencies like
jq,curl,msmtp. And also configure the msmtp fifile:///root/Documents/DoneProjects/README.md
le.To run the script type: 
'bash filename.sh --help' in terminal
